  <p>Darren Lacy has more than 20 years of experience cooking in the Bay Area. Darren began his kitchen journey as a curious 17-year-old working at a Cajun-Creole restaurant near his home, the New Orleans Bar and Grill in Montclair, California. Next Darren worked in many fine dining establishments during their peak periods with many great Bay Area chefs: first with the acclaimed Chef Bradley Ogden at Lark Creek Inn, then with Chef Todd Humphries and Chef Laurant Manrique at Campton Place, and finally with Chef Craig Stoll at Delfina. Darren became Executive Chef at the Chancellor Hotel in Union Square, where he developed a menu committed to local, seasonal produce and participated in many culinary events, such as SF Chefs 2010 and the Crab Cracking Contest, an annual fundraiser for the San Francisco 49ers Foundation, for which he was the Crab Cracking Champion in 2008. Darren is also a proud supporter of CHEFS program, giving at risk youth and San Francisco's homeless a chance to learn and receive hand-on training for how to start and maintain a career in the culinary profession. JD's Revenge is now the next chapter in a long and distinguished career.</p>
